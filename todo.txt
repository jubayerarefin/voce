Possible future ideas
=====================

* try out festvox voice importing

* let users add stuff to dictionary file?
	- dictionary file must be put somewhere accessible yet still specified in the config file
	- replace vocabulary.txt
	- write instructions for adding words/phonemes to dictionary

* "SimpleBreadthFirstSearchManager and flatLinguist are good for small to medium vocabularies"; "WordPruningBreadthFirstSearchManager and lexTreeLinguist are better for larger vocabularies"
	- experiment with these other options?
