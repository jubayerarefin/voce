Version 0.9.2
(not yet released)
------------------------------------------

	* 4-14-06: Made two changes to the C++ voce.h file: 1) changed an error message (related to the Voce class path) to be more clear, and 2) extended the size of a static internal character array (from 1024 to 4096 characters) in case the user-defined class path is really long.

	* 4-14-06: Added "isSpeaking" to the API, which helps users determine when the synthesizer is finished.


Version 0.9.1
February 9, 2006
------------------------------------------

	* 9-23-05: Fixed a bug in the SpeechRecognizer class that made it impossible to restart recognition after stopping it.

	* 9-21-05: Fixed a bug in the SpeechRecognizer class that caused a deadlock when disabling speech recognition.  The deadlock only became apparent after testing it on a multi-core machine.
